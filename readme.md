# MACC Scoreboard GUI Program

## Introduction
This is a project a former MACC player threw together as a Christmas Break project. It's kind of thrown together and I decided not to bother programming it in a proper OOP way.  It is stablish and somewhat customizable.  Fellow nerds at other schools can fork it to make a custom version.  Currently, it supports keeping up with the score and the subject area currently playing.  The interface is very basic and easy to use. All MACC players are free to alter the program as long as the link to this GitHub page remains visible on the scoreboard during play.

## Tech Details 
This program is written in Python 3.7 and uses the Tkinter GUI library.  It consists of a single .py file that can be run in the terminal or command prompt.  A .exe file for windows computers to easily use is in the works.
